# Infrastructure

Terraform state for development is stored in `gs://animated-graph-cloud-jp-tfstate` with object versioning and public access prevention. The state bucket is the only manually bootstrapped resource because Terraform cannot create its own backend.

`infra/dev` adopts the existing default Firestore database, manages required APIs, and creates foundational development resources. Secret containers intentionally have no versions; secret values are added only through a secure operator workflow.

```sh
terraform -chdir=infra/dev init
terraform -chdir=infra/dev plan -out=dev.tfplan
terraform -chdir=infra/dev apply dev.tfplan
```
